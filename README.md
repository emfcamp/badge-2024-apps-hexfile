# Hexfile

Hexfile is a Tildagon file explorer. 

It allows file operations to be performed on the badge itself. These include Cut, Copy, Paste and Delete for files and folders, Rename Files and create diectories with mkdir.

Hexfile can be used on any mounted storage, including Hexpansion eeproms and other storage on Hexpansions.

The Copy function can only copy folders up to 3 levels deep, but can be used multiple times if deeper copies are required. 

The Copy function also prevents copying app.py or app.mpy files to root '/' directory as this will likely cause the badge to hang on reboot. However you can rename a file to either of these if already in the root directory.
